/*
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher,
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have
at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
*/
/**
 * @param {number[]} citations
 * @return {number}
 */
var hIndex = function(citations) {
  let len = citations.length;
  let result = new Array(len+1).fill(0);
  for (let i of citations){
    if (i > len) result[len] ++;
    else result[i] ++;
  }

  let total = 0;
  for (let i=len; i >= 0; i--){
    total += result[i];
    if (total >= i)
      return i;
  }
  return 0;

};

console.log(hIndex([3,0,6,1,5]));
console.log(hIndex([3,0,6,1,5,4]));
